# About this project

This is a project made by me for the ScandiPWA Junior React Developer role test.
It is intented to be a showcase and its not ready for production.

It is scaffolded with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state-manegement as well as [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for client-side routing and [Opus](https://github.com/tilework/opus) as a way to consume the GraphQL endpoint provided for the test.


To run this project you need the graphql endpoint provided for the test [here](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint).
